HOW TO GET BearerToken:
get the BearerToken to the acc by opening dev tools f12 or ctrl+shift+i
there will be a new tab that appers and at the top of the tab will be some other tabs
 click the tab that says network, if you cant find one  click the two right arrow things and then click the network button on the dropdown that appeared
now refresh the page
now go to the filter at the top left of the network tab
and change the filter to myClassesEnabled
click on the first result
make sure you are in the headers part
at the bottom of the new tab, kinda bottom left you will see "request headers"
under that look for something called gwstoken and copy the token after "Authorization:" (also copy the Bearer part)
EX: Bearer g00-1768427876-64r1896920c45b85f4ea8241j2r0dr3b
